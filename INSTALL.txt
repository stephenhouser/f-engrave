

For True Type fonts to be read by F-engrave the ttf2cxf_stream program needs to be compiled and placed in the system path or the directory from which f-engrave-xx.py is called.

F-Engrave will function properly without the ttf2cxf executable but it will not show or read .ttf files.

The fengrave.ico and py2exe_setup.py files are used to create the windows binary files with py2exe. (they are not required for anything else)
